	This is a weapon and armor overhaul that changes the way weapons and armor are 
	unlocked via a re-worked Research and Foundry Project Progression.

				Required Mods\Files:
				-Long War b15f3
				-Patcher GUI

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

				Modified Classes:
				-XGFacility_Labs
				-XGFacility_Engineering
				-XGFacility_Barracks
				-XGHeadquarters
				-XGTechTree
				-XGItemTree

	Features:
		Re-worked Research Tech Tree:  Tech Tree that has definable paths that 
		require choices, choosing specific techs will lock off access to others:
			-Beam, Pulse, and EMP are their own path
			-Advanced Ballistics, Gauss, and Fusion are their own path
			-Choosing Beam locks you off from Advanced Ballistics and subsequent 
				research
			-Choosing Advanced Ballistics locks you off from Beam and subsequent 
				research
			-Choosing Gene Mod Recovery locks you off from Mobile Combat 
				Exoskeletons and Heavy Combat Exoskeletons
			-Choosing Mobile Combat Exoskeletons or Heavy Combat Exoskeletons 
				locks you off from Gene Mod Recovery

	Re-defined Techs:  Certain techs have been modified in order to balance the different 
			   definable paths that only allow one direction choice
		-Gene Mod Recovery(removes Improved Combat Exoskeletons): reduces fatigue 
			penalty for Gene Mods
		-Advanced Fusion Weaponry(removes Vehicular Plasma Weapons): increases the 
			effectiveness of Fusion weapons
		-Advanced Ballistic Weaponry(removes Precision Plasma Weapons): increases the 
			effectiveness of Ballistic weapons
		-Advanced Cooling Technology(removes Heavy Plasma Weapons): used to 
			restructure unlocking of weapons and armor
		-Micro Techologies(removes Compact Plasma Weapons): used to restructure 
			unlocking of weapons and armor
		-Alien Cybernetics(removes Experimental Warfare): used to restructure 
			unlocking of weapons and armor

	Additional Foundry Projects:  In order to restructure the gameplay in a unique way 
				      I have created additional foundry projects which is 
				      what will be used to unlock different tiers of weapons
		-MEC Exoskeleton Advancements
		-Improved MEC Defense Systems
		-Improved MEC Power Systems
		-Beam Cooling Systems
		-Beam Alloy Chasis
		-Advanced Beam Discharge
		-Improved Gauss Ammo Casing
		-Fused Gauss Chamber
		-Gauss Interchangable Core
		-Pulse Discharge Adaptation
		-Enhanced Pulse Charge
		-Enhanced Fusion Concepts

	Customizable Weapon Class System:  There is a new .ini file that will be attached 
					   with the download, DefaultAltTree.ini.  Rather than 
					   add more things to the existing DGC.ini file I 
					   wanted to make things much simpler to locate.  
					   Inside the new .ini file you will find instruction 
					   on how to properly make adjustments without causing 
					   issues with the game.

	Item Restructure:  Many of the item requirements have been changed to mix up the 
			   gameplay for those already familiar with how Long War works

	Future Plans:  This is my initial beta release, I have plans to add more features and 
		       changes in the future along with fixing many issues that I'm aware of 
		       or that are pointed out to me
		-Create a hack to allow changes to reflect via the in game UI
		-Adjust the research and foundry images to better reflect the appropriate 
			tech/project

	This mod started as just a simple Tech/Project rework to require foundry projects in 
	order to unlock weapon types, it has since taken on a life of it's own and I have 
	enjoyed adding more and more features.  I am open to suggestions and feedback for any 
	that choose to try my mod.

	I wanted to go ahead and release a workable version of my mod so that others could 
	experience the changes I've made, if you have questions or issues feel free to 
	contact me via PM on this site.  I hope you enjoy these changes as much as I am!
