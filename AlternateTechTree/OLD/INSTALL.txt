==       ALTERNATE TECHTREE INSTALLATION         ==
===================================================

Alternate TechTree requires you to have previously downloaded the Long War mod in order to be installed.
This mod is compatible for install with PatcherGUI

Alternate TechTree requires a new game, the only way to activate this mod is to make sure you
select it's associated 2nd Wave option.

NEW INSTALLATION STEPS

1. Copy AlternateTechTree.txt into your Mods folder and select & install it with your
   other mods using PatcherGUI

2. Copy AlternateTechTree.u into your XEW\XComGame\CookedPCConsole folder.  
   e.g. C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\Common\XCom-Enemy-Unknown\XEW\XComGame\CookedPCConsole
   
   **IMPORTANT: Don't forget the "XEW", otherwise you're installing it into 
     the EU folder and this won't work!**

3. Copy DefaultAltTree.ini into the XEW\XComGame\Config folder. This should
   be a sibling folder to the CookedPCConsole folder.
   
	**IMPORTANT: DefaultAltTree.ini has data entered as I chose to install it in my own
	game, this is where you will make all changes related to Alternate TechTree. **

4. Edit XEW\XComGame\Config\DefaultMutatorLoader.ini and add the following lines to the
   bottom of the file:

        arrStrategicMutators="AlternateTechTree.AltTechTreeMutate"
	arrStrategicMutators="AlternateTechTree.AltTechTree"
	arrStrategicMutators="AlternateTechTree.AltItemTree"

5. Copy AlternateTechTree.int into XEW\Localization\INT folder.  Once again 'Localization' 
   should be a sibling folder to the CookedPCConsole folder.

6. Since this mod is activated via it's associated 2nd Wave option, in order to have that 2nd Wave option
   show up you will have to add a couple lines to XComGame.int([path to Steam]...
   ...Steam\SteamApps\common\XCom-Enemy-Unknown\XEW\XcomGame\Localization\INT\XComGame.int)

	m_arrGameplayToggleDesc[30]="Alternate Tech Tree reworks several key systems inside Xcom.  Research will become directional, if you choose a specific path other research options become unavailable.  Also many additional foundry projects become available and progression becomes more reliant on them."
